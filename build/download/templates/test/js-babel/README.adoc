= Asciidoctor Reveal.js integration with Babel

This little frame was built to demonstrate a problem when trying to integrate Asciidoctor-reveal.js in a modern javascript project like Reactjs.

You can look at `main.js` to know how to integrate asciidoctor-revealjs into such a framework and we can test from time to time to see if it still works.


== Usage

Install the dependencies:

 $ npm install

Optional: To install a development version of Asciidoctor-reveal.js (1.1.4 for example):

1. Build npm package (see instructions in `HACKING.adoc` to do so)
2. Install devel npm package with:
+
 $ npm i --save ../../asciidoctor-reveal.js-1.1.4-dev.tgz

Test the project:

 $ npm test

You should obtain HTML looking output on the console that looks like a reveal.js presentation.
